# Overview

Provides a library of common functions that can be called from either a Clojure or Clojurescript application.

The functions are categorized by namespace as follows:

- [core](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.core.html):
  Functions that complement those in clojure.core, operating on the main clojure collections.
- [math](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.math.html):
  Simple mathematical functions and functions dealing with floats.
- [graphics](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.graphics.html)
  ([color](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.graphics.color.html),
   [interpolate](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.graphics.interpolate.html),
   [line](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.graphics.line.html)):
  functions useful in graphics and drawing calculations.
- [state](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.state.html):
  functions working with maps used to representing persisted application state (eg migration)
- [version](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.version.html):
  functions dealing with version number manipulation and comparison
- [config](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.config.html):
  functions to support using edn files for global and environment specific configuration.
