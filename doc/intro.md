# Overview

Provides a library of common functions that can be called from either a Clojure or Clojurescript application.

The functions are categorized by namespace as follows:

|Namespace|Description|
|---|---|
|[core](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.core.html)|Functions that complement those in clojure.core, operating on the main clojure collections.|
|[math](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.math.html)|Simple mathematical functions and functions dealing with floats.|
|[graphics](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.graphics.html) ([color](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.graphics.color.html), [interpolate](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.graphics.interpolate.html), [line](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.graphics.line.html))|Functions useful in graphics and drawing calculations.|
|[state](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.state.html)|Functions working with maps used to representing persisted application state (eg migration)
|[version](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.version.html)|Functions dealing with versioning and references to keyed assets/data|
|[config](file:///Users/craig/Documents/dev/clojure/qumunity/cljc-common/target/doc/nicheware.platform.utilities.common.config.html)|Functions to support using edn files for global and environment specific configuration.|
